# orchard

Collection of TypeScript utils for everyday use. Written in Deno to be simple
and without external dependencies. These functions are small and don't share too
much code so they can easily be extracted into codebase or modified.

This is an eclectic collection of code that don't follow coherent topic. Mostly
it's code that is useful for my projects or code that I don't want to write
twice.

> NPM/Node treated as necessary evil so this code is compiled with `dnt` into
> ESM modules.
